# project-binary-search-trees

Project Binary Trees from TOP - Ruby Curriculum

Goal is to create a tree class that functions as a binary search tree and a node class that holds data + its children.

It must be able to run a sample driver script guide provided:

Write a simple driver script that does the following:

> Create a binary search tree from an array of random numbers (Array.new(15) { rand(1..100) })
> Confirm that the tree is balanced by calling #balanced?
> Print out all elements in level, pre, post, and in order
> Unbalance the tree by adding several numbers > 100
> Confirm that the tree is unbalanced by calling #balanced?
> Balance the tree by calling #rebalance
> Confirm that the tree is balanced by calling #balanced?
> Print out all elements in level, pre, post, and in order
