# project-binary-search-trees

Project Binary Trees from TOP - Ruby Curriculum

Goal is to create a tree class that functions as a binary search tree and a node class that holds data + its children.

It must be able to run a sample driver script guide provided:

Write a simple driver script that does the following:

1. Create a binary search tree from an array of random numbers (Array.new(15) { rand(1..100) })
2. Confirm that the tree is balanced by calling #balanced?
3. Print out all elements in level, pre, post, and in order
4. Unbalance the tree by adding several numbers > 100
5. Confirm that the tree is unbalanced by calling #balanced?
6. Balance the tree by calling #rebalance
7. Confirm that the tree is balanced by calling #balanced?
8. Print out all elements in level, pre, post, and in order
